Spotter
=======

GPS based social network (iOS) - Experimental

## Idea
You can add groups, each group has a map layer and spots/map pins, the user can share events with their friends. Each group has a chat room, user list, images and spots.

## Example
I create the "Parties Group", then, I add friends, after that, me or my friends can add Pins to the group layer (map), we can share photos and chat in that group.
